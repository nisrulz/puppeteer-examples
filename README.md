I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
  1. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
  1. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
  1. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
  1. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/puppeteer-examples/issues) first, before filing an issue.
  1. Have fun!
